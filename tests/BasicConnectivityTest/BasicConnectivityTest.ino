 * @file BasicConnectivityTest.ino
 * Use this to test connectivity with your DW1000Ng from Arduino.
 * It performs an arbitrary setup of the chip and prints some information.
 * 
 * @todo
 *  - move strings to flash (less RAM consumption)
 *  - make real check of connection (e.g. change some values on DW1000Ng and verify)
